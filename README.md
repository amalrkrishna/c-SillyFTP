# c-SillyFTP

The control channel must use a UDP socket and the data transfer should be over a TCP socket connection. The client should take the file name of an existing file at the client machine as user input. The client side program should read the file and transfer the content to the server. Server program should write the received contents to a local file at the server machine. The size of the file as well as the contents at the server and client should match.
